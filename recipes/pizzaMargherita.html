    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza Margherita (more commonly known in English as Margherita pizza) is a typical Neapolitan pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and extra-virgin olive oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Dough</h4></li>
            <li>1 envelope active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups warm water (90°F to 105°F), divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li><h4>Toppings</h4></li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce) can peeled whole San Marzano tomatoes, drained</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 pounds buffalo mozzarella, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>32 large basil leaves, torn into pieces</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a large bowl, mix the yeast with 1/2 cup of the warm water and the sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of warm water, flour, and kosher salt and stir until dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface and knead, adding flour as necessary until a silky and soft dough forms. Use a pastry scraper to help knead the dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and brush all over with olive oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for up to 3 days.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; punch down and divide into 4 pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Rub each ball with oil and transfer to a baking sheet. Cover the balls loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place for 1 hour.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, set a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500°F, allowing at least 45 minutes for the stone to heat. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill set over a medium bowl or pulse them in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Stir in the oregano and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>On a lightly floured surface, stretch one ball of dough into a 13-inch round; transfer to a floured pizza peel, adding flour where the dough sticks. Spread 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over the dough to within 1 inch of the edge. Spread one-fourth of the cheese over the pizza and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Season with sea salt and pepper and slide the pizza onto the stone. Bake until the bottom is charred and the cheese is melted, about 8 minutes. Scatter one-fourth of the basil on top and let stand for 3 minutes before serving. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.</p></li>
